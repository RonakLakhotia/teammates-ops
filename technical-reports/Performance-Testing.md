## Introduction

This report gives a brief overview of the profiling operations performed on TEAMMATES. It gives an outline of the
problem and describes the reasons behind our proposed solution.

## Problem

TEAMMATES is one of the biggest student projects in the open source community. Currently, TEAMMATES boasts of a community comprising over 450 developers and a codebase 
of nearly 130LoC. Maintaining such a project demands high quality standards to ensure long term survival. This means, 
continuously monitoring code health and product performance. As the number of developers and user base continue to grow,
we need to ensure optimal performance at all times. In this report, we propose a viable solution to perform regression 
tests that will help developers keep a track of the potential bottlenecks and areas of optimizations. This will help
boost the performance as the product evolves over time.
